# Church of England Diocesan Financial Analysis (2014-2023)

<!-- - üèõÔ∏è **Parish demographics and structures** -->


The Church of England regularly publishes a wide range of statistics to support research and decision-making, including:

- üí∑ Parish finance statistics  
- üìÖ Church attendance statistics  
- Ministry statistics  
- Cathedral statistics  
- Energy Footprint Tool and Energy Toolkit  
- Fresh Expressions of Church  

While these are all valuable areas of study, this project analyzes financial trends across Church of England dioceses over a 10-year period, examining income and expenditure patterns to identify key insights and regional variations.

The goal is to help congregations to see how their contributions create ministry impact while maintaining the financial transparency that builds trust and accountability. This is achieved through visualizations, and interactive tools. 

Whether you're a researcher, church leader, policy maker, or simply curious about the Church's presence and impact across England, this project aims to provide meaningful insights grounded in real data.

## üîç Data Sources
All data used in this project is sourced from official Church of England open datasets and publications (ref: Parish-Finance-Statistics-2023.pdf).
The data presents a national summary of financial activity for Church of England parishes in 2023, as measured through the annual Return of Parish Finance.

## üöÄ Features

- Cleaned and structured datasets ranging years from 2014 to 2023
- Interactive visualizations and dashboards exploring trends and patterns
- Dynamic filter tools for comparing dioceses, and years

## üìà Sample Visualization

**Summary:**
To provide meaningful comparisons, this first dashboard shows the long-term trend in income and expenditure from 2003 to 2022. Although 2023 saw income and expenditure recover to pre-pandemic levels, they continue to be eroded by the effects of inflation. Real terms income and expenditure (i.e. adjusted for inflation) were both slightly down on corresponding totals from 2022. Real terms income was 15% lower and expenditure 16% lower than in 2019. Income continued to exceed expenditure, as it has done every year since 2011, with a 3.5% margin reported for 2023. Real terms expenditure was lower in 2023 than in any of the previous twenty years.
