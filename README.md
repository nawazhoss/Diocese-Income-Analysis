# 📊 Diocese Income & Expenditure Introduction

<!-- - 🏛️ **Parish demographics and structures** -->


The Church of England regularly publishes a wide range of statistics to support research and decision-making, including:

- Church attendance statistics  
- Parish finance statistics  
- Ministry statistics  
- Cathedral statistics  
- Energy Footprint Tool and Energy Toolkit  
- Fresh Expressions of Church  

While these are all valuable areas of study, this project specifically concentrates on the Church's financial performance aggregated to diocesan level. It explores the 
**sources of income**, **areas of expenditure**, and **Church attendance**. 

The goal is to help a congregation to see how their contributions create ministry impact while maintaining the financial transparency that builds trust and accountability. This is achieved through visualizations, and interactive tools. 

Whether you're a researcher, church leader, policy maker, or simply curious about the Church's presence and impact across England, this project aims to provide meaningful insights grounded in real data.
