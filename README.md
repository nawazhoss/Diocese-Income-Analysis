# 📊 Diocese Income Analysis

This repository explores and visualises publicly available data published by the Church of England, including:

- 📅 **Church attendance trends**
- 💷 **Parish finance and giving**
<!-- - 🏛️ **Parish demographics and structures** -->


The Church of England regularly publishes a wide range of statistics to support research and decision-making, including:

- Church attendance statistics  
- Parish finance statistics  
- Ministry statistics

While these are all valuable areas of study, this project specifically concentrates on income & expenditure aggregated to diocesan level, mainly
**sources of income**, **areas of expenditure**, and **Church attendance**. The aim is to make this particular dataset more accessible and insightful through analysis, visualizations, and interactive tools.
