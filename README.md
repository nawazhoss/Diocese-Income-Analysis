# Diocesan Financial Analysis

<!-- - üèõÔ∏è **Parish demographics and structures** -->


The Church of England regularly publishes a wide range of statistics to support research and decision-making, including:

- Parish finance statistics          
- Church attendance statistics  
- Ministry statistics  
- Cathedral statistics  
- Energy Footprint Tool and Energy Toolkit  
- Fresh Expressions of Church  

While these are all valuable areas of study, monitoring financial performance is important for keeping track of an organization‚Äôs financial health and for finding out where it might be vulnerable,
and identify when it is necessary to take action. The goal is to help congregations to see how their contributions create ministry impact while maintaining the financial transparency that builds trust and accountability. 
Whether you're a researcher, church leader, policy maker, or simply curious about the Church's presence and impact across England, this project aims to provide meaningful insights grounded in real data.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis covers:
- **Time Period**: 2014-2023 (10 years), but begins, initially, with a 20-year overview of the income & expenditure trend across all dioceses
- **Geographic Scope**: All Church of England dioceses
- **Financial Metrics**: Annual income and expenditure data
- **Data Source**: Church of England parish finance statistics

### üìä [Income & Expenditure Trends - 20 Year Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nawaz.hossain/viz/diocesan_dashboard1/Dashboard1) 

**Features:**
- 20-year overview of financial trends across all dioceses
- **Filters Available**: Filter by individual dioceses
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover for detailed figures, click to highlight specific years
- Compares actual income and expenditure with values adjusted for inflation (real terms 2023)

**Summary:**
To provide meaningful comparisons, this first dashboard shows the long-term trend in income and expenditure from 2003 to 2022. Although 2023 saw income and expenditure recover to pre-pandemic levels, they continue to be eroded by the effects of inflation. Real terms income and expenditure (i.e. adjusted for inflation) were both slightly down on corresponding totals from 2022. Real terms income was 15% lower and expenditure 16% lower than in 2019. Income continued to exceed expenditure, as it has done every year since 2011, with a 3.5% margin reported for 2023. Real terms expenditure was lower in 2023 than in any of the previous twenty years.

**Features:**
- Overview of income and expenditure across all dioceses
- **Filters Available**: Select specific dioceses
- **Interactive Elements**: Click category names to focus, hover for exact values

The largest costs were mission and ministry (comprising diocesan Common Fund contributions, mission giving, mission outreach and staff expenses, of which ¬£315 million were through contributions to diocesan Common Fund. 

### üìä [The Common Fund](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nawaz.hossain/viz/diocesan_dashboard4/Dashboard4) 

**Features:**
- Focus on Diocesan Common Fund contributions across all dioceses
- **Filters Available**: Select specific categories of spending

**Summary:**
The Church of England Common Fund is a contribution from every church in the Church of England towards the costs of ministry and mission across their diocese. It's essentially a system of financial sharing between parishes and their dioceses.
The Common Fund works by having parishes contribute funding to their diocese in order to fund expenditure at the diocesan level, much of which is in support of the parishes. This includes covering costs of stipendiary clergy, including stipends, pensions, housing and training.
